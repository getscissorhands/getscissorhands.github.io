  What is ScissorHands.NET?
---

ScissorHands.NET is a static site generator based on [Blazor](https://blazor.net).

## Why ScissorHands.NET?

There are many static site generators written in many different languages, but it's rare to find one in .NET.

Blazor uses the razor template engine to generate HTML pages. By using this capability, ScissorHands.NET locally generates HTML pages without having to host the app on a server-side.

## Goal

The goal of ScissorHands.NET is simple&mdash;It's easy to use, highly flexible for future extension through plugins, and highly customisable through themes.

## Where to start?
